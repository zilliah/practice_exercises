# Daily Code Practice

I like to push at least one practice problem a day, using Codewars for problems. [See my Codewars profile](https://www.codewars.com/users/zilliah).

# About

At the moment I write all problems in Javascript. In the future I would like to start working on problems in Python and Go.
